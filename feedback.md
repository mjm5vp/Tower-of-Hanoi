# Project 1 Evaluation

## Deployment

**3: Performing**
> The app is deployed to gh-pages

## Technical Requirements

**3: Excelling**
> App functions with minimal or no errors. You definitely pushed yourself on this, including timers and animations.

## Code Quality

**2: Performing**
> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues. Be sure to not leave code you're not using in the master branch of an application.

Things you'd like specific feedback on:
I started off well by doing OOP using objects on the tower and user plus a class for the blocks, but soon started adding functions on to the end and using a lot of global variables. Does the structure of my code seem reasonable or should it be more object oriented. What is the main downside of using a lot of global variables, as long as they are uniquely identified.

> You code looks great! It's not necessarily that object-oriented is better, just a different coding paradigm. For a  game app, it might not necessarily make sense to take an object-oriented approach because you're dealing with a smaller scale application. That said, it's always good to practice. If the global variables are uniquely identified, it shouldn't cause issues but it is considered best practice to limit them when possible. For one, you might not be the only one working on an application and it should be clear where you can access a variable. Also, what if you use a global variable and don't put that variable inside a function? Perhaps someone else working on the code may not know it's available and add it in again under a different name. It's just organizationally- better and a way to keep your code safe  to always use the var keyword and not make variables accessible where they're not needed.



## Creativity and Interface

**3: Excelling**
> The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. The animation on the stones is really cool and definitely. The design is really user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. One thought might be to style the dropdown when selecting the number of stones. The default one in't too great.
